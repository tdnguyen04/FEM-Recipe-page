## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
- Horizontal rule can be created by setting proper top-border of a ```<div>``` element
- Set image width to fit with the container by using ```max-width: 100%;```
- For ```<ol>``` and ```<ul>```, padding-left is to indent the line even further
- For ```li```, padding-left is to create space between marker box of list item and content

### Continued development
I want to find a way to plan Sass structure better. Currently, I am using Sass basically the same as CSS, except that it has some reset files that look formal to me. 
Also, as part of this project, I am going to come back to refactor the code even more.

### Useful resources

- [Add line between rows in CSS grid](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56900389/css-grid-how-to-add-line-between-rows) - This helps me put line between the nutrition table's rows. Also, I realize I could further customize ```<hr>``` if using ```<div>``` instead of horizontal rule.
- [Marker in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::marker) - This helps me understand the structure of list items (such as markers, the difference between left-padding of ```<ul>```, ```<ol>``` with that of ```<li>```)
