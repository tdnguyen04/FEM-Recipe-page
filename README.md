## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
- Horizontal rule can be created by setting proper top-border of a ```<div>``` element
- Set image width to fit with the container by using ```max-width: 100%;```

### Continued development
I want to find a way to plan Sass structure better. Currently, I am using Sass basically the same as CSS, except that it has some reset files that look formal to me. 
Also, as part of this project, I am going to come back to refactor the code even more.
